## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive analysis and forecasting model for product sales at Kellogg's using historical sales data and associated datasets. The analysis aims to identify patterns and trends to improve sales predictions, ultimately supporting strategic decision-making.

## Incorporated Datasets
The following datasets were utilized in this analysis:
- **Product Data:** Information on the various products, including categories, pricing, and features.
- **Sales Data:** Historical sales records, including quantities sold and sales revenue over time.
- **Store Data:** Information about different store locations, including size, type, and regional characteristics.
- **Customer Supplements Data:** Additional customer information that may influence purchasing behaviour, such as demographics and buying habits.

## Code Sections
The code is organized into several key sections to facilitate clarity and reproducibility:

1. **Data Extracting/Mining:** This section covers the methods used to gather and preprocess the data from the various sources.
2. **Data Exploration:** We explore the datasets to understand their structure, content, and relationships among variables.
3. **Data Visualization:** Visual representations of data are used to effectively identify trends, patterns, and insights.
4. **Feature Engineering:** It is selecting, modifying, or creating new features to improve model performance.
5. **Modeling:** Implement forecasting models to predict future sales based on historical data.
6. **Forecasting:** Generating predictions and evaluating model performance based on specific metrics.

## Approach
The analysis follows a structured approach that includes data extraction, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning algorithms to accurately forecast future sales. 

## Data Visualization
Data visualization plays a crucial role in identifying patterns and trends in datasets. Various visualization techniques, such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps, are employed to present findings clearly and effectively.

## Modeling and Forecasting
Different forecasting models are applied, including:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Time Series Analysis**
- **Machine Learning Models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)**

The models are evaluated based on their predictive accuracy and effectiveness in capturing the trends in the sales data.

## Results
Results regarding the model's accuracy, sales forecasts, and insights derived from the analysis will be presented. Detailed visualizations and comparisons of different models' performances will also be included.

## Future Work
Potential areas for further development include:
- Incorporating additional data sources, such as economic indicators or promotional activities.
- Exploring advanced modelling techniques, such as neural networks or ensemble methods, for improved forecasting accuracy.
- Implementing a real-time dashboard for ongoing sales monitoring and predictions.
